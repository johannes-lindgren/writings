# Introduction

This book aims to be a brief, yet comprehensive introduction to TypeScript for programmers who are already familiar with JavaScript. We'll start by exploring what types _are_, then start with basic syntax and work ourselves up to more advanced use cases. We'll cover topics such as:

- different kinds of types; such as literal types, unions, tuples, arrays, functions, objects
- higher order types; such as generics, mapped types, and utility types.
- how TypeScript processes types; including type checking, type inference, type guards, type predicates, and type assertions.

Along the way, I hope to provide a good intuition of how to understand TypeScript's type system.

However, before delving deep into TypeScript's syntax, let's motivate the need for TypeScript in the first place.
