# Introduction

This is a brief introduction to TypeScript for programmers who are already familiar with JavaScript. We'll start with the most basic language features and work ourselves up to more advanced features that lets us utilize the full power of the type checker. We'll cover topics such as:

- type annotation, type checking, type inference, type guards, type predicates, and type assertions.
- literal types and primitive types
- union types (sum types)
- tuples, and records (product types)
- arrays (recursive types)
- function types (exponential types)
- generic types (parametric types)

However, before delving deep into TypeScript's syntax, let's first explore what motivates us to adopt TypeScript in the first place, and how TypeScript relates to JavaScript.
